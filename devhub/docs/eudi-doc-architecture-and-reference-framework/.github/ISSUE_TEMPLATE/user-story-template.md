Add the scenario description here

### Priority
**Level**: Specify the priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low). This MUST reflect how critical the story is to the project.

Example:
The priority level for this story is set as **High**. It is crucial to the project's success in the current phase, aligning closely with our strategic goals for the quarter. This feature has been highly anticipated by both our users and stakeholders, and its timely delivery is essential for meeting our projected growth and engagement targets.

### Estimates
**Effort**: Provide an estimate of the effort required. This COULD be in time units (e.g., hours, days) or using a point system.

Example:
The estimated effort for completing this user story is approximately **90 hours** of development time. This estimate includes the time required for research, implementation, testing, and documentation. It assumes a collaborative effort from our development, design, and QA teams to ensure that the feature is implemented efficiently and meets our quality standards.

### Technical Notes and Constraints
**Notes**: List any technical considerations, limitations, or constraints that SHOULD be taken into account. This MAY include specific technologies, integration points, or performance criteria.

Example:
Technical considerations for this feature include ensuring compatibility with our existing architecture and third-party services. We must also adhere to performance criteria, such as load times and responsiveness, to maintain a seamless user experience. There are limitations regarding the integration with certain legacy systems, which may require creative solutions or temporary workarounds.


### Dependencies
**Related Stories and Tasks**: Identify any dependencies on other user stories, tasks, or functionalities. This SHOULD outline if the story can be developed independently or MUST wait for other work to be completed.

Example:
This user story depends on the completion of related tasks, including API updates (US-123) and database schema changes (US-124), which are currently in progress. Development of this feature should not commence until these dependencies are resolved to avoid rework and ensure that the feature can be integrated smoothly into our existing platform.
