# Architecture and Reference Framework

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) outlines the specifications required to develop an interoperable European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet Solution based on common standards and practices. It defines high-level requirements to ensure consistent implementation across Member States.

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) is a work in progress that is continuously updated. It reflects the collaborative efforts among the 27 Member States, the European Commission, and, where relevant, private sector operators.
