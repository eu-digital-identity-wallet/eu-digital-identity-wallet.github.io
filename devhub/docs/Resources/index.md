# EUDI Wallet Resources

To support your introduction to the EUDI Wallet, weâ€™ve gathered essential resources that provide a comprehensive foundation. Dive into technical specifications, explore the regulatory framework, and gain insights from real-world pilot projects. These materials are designed to help you understand the EUDI Wallet from all critical perspectives.

## Master the Architecture and Reference Framework

Discover the key specifications and guidelines needed to develop an interoperable EUDI Wallet solution. This framework provides a solid foundation based on common standards and best practices to ensure seamless integration and functionality. 

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) outlines the specifications required to develop an interoperable European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet Solution based on common standards and practices. It defines high-level requirements to ensure consistent implementation across Member States.

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) is a work in progress that is continuously updated. It reflects the collaborative efforts among the 27 Member States, the European Commission, and, where relevant, private sector operators.

## Delve into the applicable Technical Standards and Specifications

The European Digital Identity Wallet initiative is supported by ongoing work to define and align relevant standards and technical specifications with the relevant Implementing Acts establishing the European Digital Identity Framework. For more information, please refer to the following resources:

## Discover the EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation consists of open-source code libraries and a reference application, which are publicly available and ready for Member States and stakeholders to use in building their own applications.

Its goal is to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.

The Reference Implementation can be used by wallet providers, issuers and Relying Parties as a basis for their own solution. It also includes a set of testing tools to support testing and ensure that your implementation meets functional requirements.
