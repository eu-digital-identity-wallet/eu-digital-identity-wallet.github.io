# EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation consists of open-source code libraries and a reference application, which are publicly available and ready for Member States and stakeholders to use in building their own applications.

Its goal is to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.

The Reference Implementation can be used by wallet providers, issuers and Relying Parties as a basis for their own solution. It also includes a set of testing tools to support testing and ensure that your implementation meets functional requirements.
