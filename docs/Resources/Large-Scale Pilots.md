# EUDI Wallet Large-Scale Pilots 

In May 2023, four Large-Scale Pilot projects were launched to rigorously test and prepare the EU Digital Identity Wallet for secure and seamless deployment. These Pilots involve approximately 360 entities, including private companies and public authorities, from 26 Member States, Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine. The projects are co-funded by European Commission grants and guided by EUDI Wallet technical specifications. Running until 2025, the pilots are structured as consortia, combining public and private sector expertise across the EU.

The Pilots aim to validate the wallet's functionality in real-life scenarios, by gathering feedback on the reference implementation to enhance its security, interoperability, and overall design. These efforts focus on practical use cases that Europeans encounter daily, spanning 11 key areas such as accessing government services, opening bank accounts, and facilitating travel.
