# Build your Verifier

## Overview

This is a web UI that provides functionality to interact with the Verifier/RP trusted endpoint implemented in this [repository](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-web-verifier-endpoint-23220-4-kt){:target="_blank"}.
Another way to think of this application is that it represents an arbitrary application that wants to delegate to the trusted endpoint the burden of
interacting with a wallet using OpenId4VP.
The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli){:target="_blank"} version 19.1.4.
