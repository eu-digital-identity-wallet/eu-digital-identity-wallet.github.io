# Run with Local Services

1. In order for the application to interact with locally running services; these must first be running on your machine. Please follow the instructions in the links below in order to have these services running locally:
	* [Issuer](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-web-issuing-eudiw-py){:target="_blank"}
	* [Web Verifier UI](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-web-verifier){:target="_blank"}
	* [Web Verifier Endpoint](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-web-verifier-endpoint-23220-4-kt){:target="_blank"}

2. In addition to the change above, you also need to allow self-signed certificates as described [here](../Self-signed Certificates).
